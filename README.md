- 👋 Hi, I’m @luigi-difranco
- 👀 I’m interested in ... becoming a Salesforce Admin, then Developer, and work my way on up to Architect. Along the way I am also wanting to hone my fullstack skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... First, relearning HTML/CSS/JS/Java/php after 10 year hiatus. Then, learning Salesforce and APEX, React/Redux, Angular, Git, C#, SQL, and everything that has changed in fullstack development over the past 10+ years. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment. I'll let you know when I'm ready.
- 📫 How to reach me ... currently I prefer not to be reached. I will update when I feel my rusty skills have been honed enough to get back out there.
