- 👋 Hi, I’m @luigi-difranco
- 👀 I’m interested in ... becoming a Salesforce Administrator, then a Developer, and then working my way on up to Architect (Dream BIG! Why not!). Along the way I am also wanting to hone my Full Stack skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently ... relearning HTML/CSS/JS/Java/PHP (after a ~10 year hiatus), while learning Salesforce (Admin/App-Builder/APEX) and also learning anything that is new to full stack web dev from the past 10 years, or so. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment. I'll let the world know when I'm ready.
- 📫 How to reach me ... preferably through some electronic media, although an old school letter or post card will work as well.
